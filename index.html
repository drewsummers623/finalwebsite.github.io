<h1>Drew Summers Final</h1>

<h2>Planetarium Logo - Project 1</h2>

<p>For the project to create a logo for Southworth Planetarium, I wanted to incorporate imagery associated with both space and USM. I used the university's mascot, Champ, and put him in a space suit to balance the two elements. In addition, I used color schemes inspired by retro futurism posters to convey the vintage feeling of the planetarium.</p>

<p> The finished logo is below.</p>

<h2>Stickbug Cryptid - Project 2</h2>

<p>For the cryptic project, I immediately knew I wanted to make something relating to my home town, a tiny community of less that 700 people in the middle of the Maine mountains. The idea I was working with was of a dangerous creature that hunts down lone hikers in the woods. I was heavily inspired by lumberjack folklore of the Hidebehind, a creature that stalks people in the wilderness, but always hides itself whenever they turn around to get a look. I composited images of stickbugs to create something stiff and distinctly non-human, and hid the creature in the background behind a hiker to create a feeling of unease.</p>

<p>The completed composite image is below</p>

<h2>What's Wrong With You? - Project 3</h2>

<p>For my video project, my goal was to convey a feeling of alienation. Specifically focusing on my experiences being aromantic, I used typically romantic imagery, such as videos of couples dancing and hearts beating. These were intercut by videos of a stopwatch, referencing the fact that the longer I take to "find the one," as they say, the more alienated I'll be. This is all with audio of a man saying things such as, "what's wrong with you?" to emphasize that alienating feeling.</p>

<h2>Distortion - Project 4</h2>

<p>For this project, I put together a video of normal domestic scenes taken from random home videos, and then coded it so that the closer you get, the more distorted the video gets. The intention was to make it nearly impossible to clearly see the video in its original format. The meaning of this is mostly up to interpretation, but it can be taken as a representation of the feeling of never being fully able to meet society's ideals.</p>

<p>The finished original video and the Arduino and Touch Designer codes are below</p>
